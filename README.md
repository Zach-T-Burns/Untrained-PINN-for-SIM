# Untrained-PINN-for-SIM
Untrained, physics-informed neural network for SIM image reconstruction

This repo contains demonstration Jupyter notebooks and data for reconstructing SIM images using an untrained physics-informed neural network (PINN).

This code is based off our publication currently available as a preprint on ArXiv:
[Untrained, Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Structured Illumination Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07705)
